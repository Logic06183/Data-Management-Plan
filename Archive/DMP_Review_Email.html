    <ul>
        <li>Moving some of our data storage to WHC-managed cloud services (keeping UCT servers too)</li>
        <li>Better security with stronger encryption and 24/7 monitoring</li>
        <li>Enhanced backup and disaster recovery</li>
        <li>Improved data access for researchers</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Documents to review (in our Box folder):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>HE2AT_DMP_v2.2_COMPLETE_with_figures.docx - main document with figures</li>
        <li>DMP_v2.2_Changes_Summary_HREC_FINAL.docx - summary of what changed</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>What we need from you:</strong></p>

        <li>Let us know if anything seems unclear</li>
        <li>Flag any concerns about procedures or compliance</li>
