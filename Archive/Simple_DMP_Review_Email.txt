Subject: Please Review: Updated Data Management Plan v2.2 - Comments by Friday Jan 17th

Hi everyone,

Hope you're all doing well. We need your help reviewing the updated Data Management Plan (version 2.2) that includes our cloud migration plans.

What's changed:
- Moving some of our data storage to WHC-managed cloud services (keeping UCT servers too)
- Better security with stronger encryption and 24/7 monitoring
- Enhanced backup and disaster recovery
- Improved data access for researchers

Documents to review (in our Box folder):
1. HE2AT_DMP_v2.2_COMPLETE_with_figures.docx - main document with figures
2. DMP_v2.2_Changes_Summary_Table.md - summary of what changed
3. HE2AT_DMP_v2.2_COMPLETE.md - text version if you prefer

What we need from you:
- Check if everything looks accurate for your area
- Let us know if anything seems unclear
- Flag any concerns about procedures or compliance

Please send comments by Friday, January 17th to:
Craig Parker (Craig.parker@witsphr.org) or 
Christopher Jack (cjack@csag.uct.ac.za)

After we get your feedback, we'll submit to HREC and start the migration process.

Questions? Just give us a call or shoot us an email.

Thanks for taking the time to review this!

Best,
Craig
